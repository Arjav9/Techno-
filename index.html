  <h1>1.Artificial intelligence:</h1>
  <p>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.AI and machine learning already play a bigger role in everyday life than you might imagine. Alexa, Siri, Amazon's product recommendations, Netflix’s and Spotify’s personalized recommendations, every Google search you make, security checks for fraudulent credit card purchases, dating apps, fitness trackers... All are driven by AI.AI is also going to transform human jobs. AI-enabled automation will have aparticularly significant impact and may lead to the displacement of many jobs.</p>

  <h1>2.Gene technology:</h1>
  <p>technology is the term given to a range of activities concerned with understanding gene expression, taking advantage of natural genetic variation, modifying genes and transferring genes to new hosts. Genes are found in all living organisms and are passed on from one generation to the next.Much of the work being done with gene editing is in the field of healthcare. Biotechnology is advancing to the point where it's viable to alter the DNA encoded within a cell; this will influence the characteristics or traits that its descendants will have. In plants, this could affect the number of leaves or their coloring, while in humans, it could affect their height, eye color, or their likelihood of developing diseases.Among the most exciting current projects is the correction of DNA mutations which can lead to serious illnesses such as cancer or heart disease. But, perhaps more than with any other technology, there are a huge number of ethical and legal concerns as well as "what if" questions when it comes to genetic manipulation and editing. Genome editing in humans is currently banned in many countries, including much of Europe, as its long-term results are not understood.</p>

  <h1>3.Extended Reality (XR):</h1>
  <p>Extended reality, or XR for short, encompasses virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality and refers to the use of technology to create more immersive digital experiences.

In practice, XR is being used to boost brand engagement, let customers try before they buy, enhance customer service, make workplace learning more effective, and improve other organizational processes.XR Technologies offer exciting and entirely new ways for people to experience the world around them. XR technology is already finding very real applications in our world, and is likely to dramatically change the way we interact with technology. In fact, mobile-based AR experiences, such as the Pokemon Go app, generated over $3 billion in global revenue in 2018.</p>

<h1>4. 3D Printing</h1>
<p>3D printing is a process in which a digital model is turned into a tangible, solid, three-dimensional object, usually by laying down many successive, thin layers of a material. 3D printing has become popular so quickly because it makes manufacturing accessible to more people than ever before. This is partly due to the price (the starting price for a basic 3D printer is about $300), but also the small size of the printers compared to traditional manufacturing.ENTERPRISE TECH.
3D Printing
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, means creating a 3D object from a digital file by building it layer by layer. 3D printing may seem distinctly more low-tech than artificial intelligence or gene editing, but it has the potential to completely transform manufacturing and other industries.

Using 3D printing, the factories of the future could quickly print spare parts for machinery on site. Entire assembly lines could be replaced with 3D printers. We could print human tissue for transplant, print weapons, even print food.


3D printing technology brings many opportunities, but it also brings some downsides, challenges, and obstacles to overcome. While it has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing by using fewer materials overall, we have to consider the environmental impact of the printers themselves.

3D printing also presents problems for intellectual property owners, since the technology enables counterfeiters to produce fake license goods cheaply and easily. There's also the problem that weapons can be easily 3D printed. One thing I find particularly exciting about 3D printing is the potential it brings for mass personalization of products. Thanks to 3D printing, products and Designs can be customized to suit one-off requests in orders, and this could cover anything from personalized sneakers to food that's personalized to our individual nutritional needs.</p>
